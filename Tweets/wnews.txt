The Student Labor Action Project (SLAP), the Student Leadership Stipend Committee (SLSC) and students around campus are advocating for Resident Assistants (RAs) and House Presidents (HPs) to receive compensation from the College in return for the work they do on campus. After a predetermined five year period, the Wellesley College administration will make a decision on whether to compensate RAs and HPs on Nov.2.

RAs and HPs are not currently compensated for their service, with the exception of receiving a single room from the college. RAs and HPs still have to pay for room and board just as everybody else does. Unlike many other colleges and universities, they do not receive free housing or an additional stipend throughout the year.

SLSC and SLAP are collaborating to approach the issue. SLSC, which typically includes RAs and HPs, has worked to receive the College Government Ballot Initiative, which is $11,000 that constitutes two percent of the collective student activities fees. According to the College, in 2014-2015, all residential students paid $276 each for the student activity fee. During the annual spring cabinet elections that occur in April, students can vote for where the money will go. SLS has won the College Government Ballot Initiative for the past five years. For the first four years, the Initiative was divided up between RAs and HPs who are on federal work-study. Last year, it was divided up between RAs and HPs who are on financial aid of any kind.
